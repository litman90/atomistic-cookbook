Running, analizing and visualizing a ring polymer instanton simulations
=======================================================================

This example shows how to run a ring polyemer instanton simulations to
compute i) tunneling rates and ii) tunneling splittings  using ``i-PI``. 
This recipe analyzes the output and visualize the trajectories in ``chemiscope``, and
uses fortran drivers.
